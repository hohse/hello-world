# hello-world
This is the noob tutorial repository, because I need to learn GitHub.

I now am supposed to write a litte something about myself. I'm trying to get to know GitHub for a project at work, where we deveolop apps for media research. Though I am not the actual developer, I'd like to understand a little bit more of how software development works. So. That's that. Now where do I add my commit message...?
